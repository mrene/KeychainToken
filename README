NAME

KeychainToken, /Library/KeychainToken/keychain_token.dylib

SYNOPSIS
 
This is the Keychain PKCS#11 Token "driver".  Use it with applications 
that cannot interact with Keychain but can interact with PKCS#11 devices
(e.g. Mozilla products)

DESCRIPTION

Apple provides a wonderful API for accessing cryptographic functions and
tokens (Smartcards, softcerts, etc) but it does not provide a way to 
access these functions via PKCS#11 anymore. This is an attempt to rectify
this in as sane a way as possible. In its first release only the minimal 
ammount of PKCS#11 will be implemented to allow basic operation with 
Mozilla products, as that suits my needs best.  However, future releases
may include additional functionality.

When using the KeychainToken driver, by default all keychains shown in 
the Keychain Access application will be visible in different slots, up 
to the maximum slots (10).  Since this is often not desireable,
KeychainToken can be configured with a properties list file (plist) 
found in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.KeychainToken.plist .  You can
create three different Array entries, titled:

 * whitelist
 * blacklist
 * greylist

In each of these array entries, create simple string entries with the 
path name of the keychain you want in the particular list. Some keychains
will show a path that is not on the filesystem (for example, DoD CAC's 
show just the serial number of the CAC), and Directory Services shows up
with an empty path.  Below is a description of each list.

 /whitelist/
 
 When the whitelist is defined at all, all keychains not in the whitelist
 or greylist will not show up at all. The blacklist will be ignored.
 
 /blacklist/
 
 When the whitelist is not defined, the blacklist is a list of keychains
 you do not wish to appear as PKCS#11 tokens.
 
 /greylist/
 
 Some keychains cannot be logged into from the PKCS#11 interface. The 
 System keychain is such an example. Adding keychains to will cause the
 KeychainToken driver to make a best attempt to tell accessing applications
 that these keychains are to be treated as read-only devices that cannnot
 be logged into.  This is only a best attempt, and some applications may
 prompt for a pin to log in. Keychains in the greylist will never use any
 login attempt on the actual keychain (to prevent accidental locking)
 
Examples of preferences setup (name:type:value):

Root:Dictionary:(2 items)
  whitelist:Array:(2 items)
    Item 1:String:/Users/joe/Library/Keychains/mytoken.keychain
    Item 2:String:CAC-1234-5678-9012-3456
  greylist:Array:(1 item)
    Item 1:String:/Users/joe/Library/Keychains/login.keychain
    

Root:Dictionary:(2 items)
  greylist:Array:(1 item)
    Item 1:String:/Users/joe/Library/Keychains/login.Keychain
  blacklist:Array:(3 items)
    Item 1:String:(empty string)
    Item 2:String:/Library/Keychains/System.keychain
    Item 3:String/Users/joe/Library/Keychains/expired_token.keychain

Future versions of KeychainToken may provide a graphical tool to configure these preferences.
